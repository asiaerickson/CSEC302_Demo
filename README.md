# CSEC302_Demo
Here are my files for my demo on Reverse Tab Nabbing!
I the base code is from HackTricks (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/reverse-tab-nabbing).
The prevention was made from information from OWASP (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#tabnabbing).
I also used OWASP for additional references (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing).
Discover Reverse Tabnabbing is a Burp extension that finds this vulnerability but is only available for the professional version (https://portswigger.net/bappstore/80eb8fd46bf847b4b17861482c2f2a30).
